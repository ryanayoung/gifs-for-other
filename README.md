[My attempt to modify ] A Browser extension that makes it easy to search GIPHY and add a GIF into any**thing** ~GitHub comment box~.


I have never made an extension before. I'm just frustrated by the current
options and this looks like a fantastic starting point. I have no timeline for
this, and it may just be a random ADHD goal that I might forget to come back
to. We'll see.
